## Configuring the Raspberry Pi to use the SSD drive

    Presuming your Raspberry Pi is up and running, you need to connect to it and alter the boot order of the device. This means itâ€™ll try to boot from the USB-attached SSD drive before trying to use the SD card.

 1. Update your bootloader
     ```bash
     sudo raspi-config
     ```
2. Select Advanced options
3. Select bootloader version
4. Select latest
5. Press esc a few times to exit
     ```bash
     sudo reboot
     
     sudo rpi-eeprom-update
     
     sudo reboot
     ```
6. If an update is available, install it.
     ```bash
     sudo rpi-eeprom-update -a
     
     sudo reboot
     ```
7. View your eeprom configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo rpi-eeprom-config
     ```

8. Edit your eeprom config
     ```bash
    sudo -E rpi-eeprom-config --edit

    sudo reboot
     ```
9. Make sure your boot order is listed as above.

        The boot order is read in reverse. 

        4 means try usb 3

        1 means try sd card

        F means start over.

        You want 0xf14 so it tries this order: USB3, SD, start over.



## Pi-hole
**Description:** The `Pi-hole`Â® is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content. I also use it as DHCP in my network.
The configuration is prety straight forward. In this case I run it directly on the Raspberry Pi.
More info here: https://pi-hole.net/

**Configuration:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

## PiVPN
**Description:** The simplest way to setup and manage a VPN, designed for Raspberry Pi. This uses Wireguard to connect to my home server securely.
Configuration is very simple, just follow the instructions.
More info here: https://www.pivpn.io/

**Configuration:**
Configuring Keepalived for High Availability
Keepalived is designed to run on two separate hosts but share a virtual IP address. This ensures that if one goes down (the master), the backup will take over using the same virtual IP.

```bash
curl -L https://install.pivpn.io | bash
```

## KeepAlived
**Description:** `Keepalived` is a routing software to provide simple and robust facilities for loadbalancing and high-availability to Linux systems. Loadbalancing framework relies on well-known and widely used Linux Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module.

In my configuration, I will use 3 machines that will run different services.
The Ubuntu machine is the primary device for HTTP traffic and will failover to the Primary Raspberry Pi.
The Raspberry Pi will act as secondary device for HTTP traffic, but will be primary for DNS requests and VPN traffic.
The reason for this configuration is that my PiHole is more likely to survive random crashes and therefore I need the basic services always available.
These are:
  - Pi-hole
  - Nginx Proxy Manager
  - SearXNG
  - Vaultwarden

More info here: https://www.keepalived.org/

### **Detailed Configuration:**
The full details on how to setup keepalived on my 3 servers can be found [HERE](https://github.com/Bolex80/Complete-AI-Media-Center-Home-Lab/blob/main/docs/high-availability.md)

### Cloudflare DDNS
**Description:** A feature-rich and robust Cloudflare DDNS updater with a small footprint. The program will detect your machineâ€™s public IP addresses and update DNS records using the Cloudflare API.
Configuration is very simple, just follow the instructions.
More info here: https://github.com/favonia/cloudflare-ddns

**Configuration:**
It is best to follow the instructions from their [github page](https://github.com/favonia/cloudflare-ddns), that way you can configure it as it best suits you and it will help you with the Cloudflare API tokens.

#### docker-compose.yml file

```yaml
services:
  cloudflare-ddns:
    image: favonia/cloudflare-ddns:latest
    # Choose the appropriate tag based on your need:
    # - "latest" for the latest stable version (which could become 2.x.y
    #   in the future and break things)
    # - "1" for the latest stable version whose major version is 1
    # - "1.x.y" to pin the specific version 1.x.y
    network_mode: host
    # This bypasses network isolation and makes IPv6 easier (optional; see below)
    restart: always
    # Restart the updater after reboot
    user: "1000:1000"
    # Run the updater with specific user and group IDs (in that order).
    # You can change the two numbers based on your need.
    read_only: true
    # Make the container filesystem read-only (optional but recommended)
    cap_drop: [all]
    # Drop all Linux capabilities (optional but recommended)
    security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]
    # Another protection to restrict superuser privileges (optional but recommended)
    environment:
      - CF_API_TOKEN=<put your token from cloudflare here> #instructions on how to get this API token are detailed in the github page
        # Your Cloudflare API token
      - DOMAINS=<whatever-you-have.com, domain2.net>
        # Your domains (separated by commas)
      - PROXIED=false
        # Tell Cloudflare to cache webpages and hide your IP (optional)

```
